# ipl_dataset_analysis

For the purpose of analyzing the IPL datasets and completing an internship shortlisting 
assignment, the Python programming language and Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda 
environment were utilized. The pandas library was imported and employed extensively for
 manipulation and analysis. Various pandas functions such as `head()`, `tail()`, `describe()`, `info()`, 
`iloc()`, `mask()`, `drop_duplicates()`, `groupby()`, `isin()`, `merge()`, `pivot_table()`, and `corr()` 
were applied to extract meaningful insigh
 data 
ts from the datasets. Additionally, data visualization 
tools like matplotlib (bargraphs, histograms, and pie charts) and seaborn (heat maps) were 
utilized to visually explore and present valuable information about the datasets.
